So the Nintendo Switch had its price and release date announced and has had a
mixed reception especially online.  Many video game critics are highlighting
that the Nintendo Switch has a limited battery life, limited processing power,
and a small selection of games at release and promised in the future.  I would
like to address some of these so called "issues" which are not as bad as they
sound.

### The Nintendo Switch is a portable first and foremost

The entire principle of the Nintendo Switch is to be a portable console with
some television connectivity, not the other way around (much like the Wii U
Gamepad was).  In 2017, people still have this mindset that Nintendo **has** to
directly compete with their immediate rivals - Microsoft and Sony.  

However, Nintendo firmly has its foothold on the "Casual gamer" market as well a
complete monopoly on the portable console market.  Microsoft and Sony focus
graphical prowess, living room solutions, and boring you with things like Usher
concerts and interviews with Pel√© during their E3 keynotes.  Nintendo focuses on
telling you about their new games, new cash cows and not much else.

With the Nintendo Switch, people seem to forget that the initial reveal trailer
showed a lot of examples using the Switch in its portable mode.  I think that
since people see the Switch as a replacement to the Wii U that it should be the
same as what the XBox One was to the XBox 360, or the PS4 was to the PS3: the
same but with some processing and graphical improvements.

That's not to say that the Switch is without its problems.  This effectively is
silently killing off Nintendo's dedicated home consoles and is potentially
alienating the competition by not keeping up with the pace of technology.

### Nintendo burned a lot of bridges but wants to fix that

Historically Nintendo loves to stick its nose into the games being developed for
its platforms and has [only acted in its own self-interests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9GpCCZ6NAE) -
which can differ between Nintendo Japan and Nintendo America, with interesting results.

The Nintendo Wii saw a virtual free-for-all for developers which caused the catalog
to saturate with sub-standard budget titles.  That combined with the non-existent
graphical upgrade the Wii got caused larger developers to turn its noses at the
Wii quite soon after release.

This was felt in the Wii U. With Nintendo having to grovel to people like Platinum
Games for exclusivity of Bayonetta 2 in order to bait early buyers, to the fiasco
that was Sonic Boom: The Rise of Lyric where Nintendo lied that the Wii U could
run the Unreal Engine.  The Wii U seemed to not even get the prime games made by
Nintendo themselves, having to settle for a swan song Zelda title, a full priced
Mario level editor, and a Miyamoto adjusted Starfox game.

It seems like is something Nintendo wants to put behind them (or at least make
the public think that), trying to get the likes of Skyrim and Dragonball Xenoverse
on the Nintendo Switch to prove to developers that they should develop for the
Switch and that they don't have to worry about Nintendo wanting exclusivity.

### The console isn't even out yet

That being said, its January just now and the Switch is out in March.  The only
people who have had their hands on a Switch are journalists and Nintendo employees.  
Even if the Switch is *physically* not up to scratch, Nintendo announced that their
online services will become a paid service.  This throws up a whole load of questions
about what they will do with the money and what that money will get you.  

Will it become like XBox Live where you have to pay for any online service (even your
friends list), or will it be like PS+ where it provides you with a richer experience
and perks like free games every month.  I suspect that since Nintendo has been trying
to tap in to the online space (with many iterations, all of which focusing on limiting
the risk to Nintendo and not benefiting its users) they will try and lure people in.

So I will conclude this stream on consciousness with something one of my friends
used to say at school: "calm your beans".  The internet is everyone's soapbox but
its easy to criticise and not focus on the positives.

*Note: As of reading this article, I have pre-ordered a Nintendo Switch, Legend
of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Xenoblade 2.*
